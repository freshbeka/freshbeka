My name is Beka and I am a graduate student at the University of Washington in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. I am a freshwater ecologist interested in understanding freshwater ecosystem function in order to steward and conserve freshwater ecosystems. Stable isotopes are a tool I frequently use. I'm here in GitHub-land because I embrace and promote the principles of open and reproducible science.
