My name is Beka and I am a graduate student and the University of Washington in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. I am a freshwater ecologist interested in using our understandings of freshwater ecosystem function to steward and conserve freshwater ecoystems. I'm here in GitHub-land because have embraced and intend to promote the principles of open and reproducible science.
